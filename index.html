                <h2>What is Expressjs ?</h2>
                <p>Express.js, or simply Express, is a web application framework for Node.js, released as free and open-source software under the MIT License. It is designed for building web applications and APIs. It has been called the de facto standard server framework for Node.js.

                    The original author, TJ Holowaychuk, described it as a Sinatra-inspired server, meaning that it is relatively minimal with many features available as plugins. Express is the back-end component of the MEAN stack, together with the MongoDB database software and AngularJS front-end framework.</p>

                <h2>Rapid Server-Side Programming</h2>
                <p>Being a Node.js framework, Express.js packages many of the commonly used Node.js features, into functions that can be easily called anywhere on the program. As a result, complex tasks that would otherwise take a Node developer several hundred lines and several hours to program can easily be done by Express JS developers in just a few lines of code and within a few minutes. Express web application development is therefore much quicker than pure Node.js development.</p>

                <h2>Routing</h2>
                <p>Routing allows a web application to preserve web page states through their URLs. These URLs may be shared with other users, and visiting these URLs will take users to the exact page state that was originally shared. Node.js has a routing mechanism, but it’s a basic and rudimentary one. Express.js offers a more advanced and efficient routing mechanism that is able to handle highly dynamic URLs.</p>

            <div class="feature">
                <h2>Debugging</h2>
                <p>All developers encounter bugs with every project that can cause entire applications to malfunction, and one of the most critical tasks of developers is identifying the source of these bugs and correcting them in the quickest possible time. Fortunately, Express.js provides an easy debugging mechanism to allow developers to quickly pinpoint which part of the application causes bugs.</p>

            <div class="feature">
                <h2>Templating</h2>
                <p>Express.js provides a templating engine that allows web pages to have dynamic content by constructing HTML templates on the server side, replacing dynamic content with their proper values, and then sending these to the client side for rendering. In addition to enabling dynamic content, it also takes a significant load from the client side which may have highly variable hardware specifications, and as such, it can make applications more efficient.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="feature">
                <h2>Middleware</h2>
                <p>
                    Express.js uses middleware to systematically arrange different function calls. A middleware is a chunk or cluster of code that has access to a user’s request, the application’s response, and the next middleware to be used. With such an architecture, it becomes easy for Express js developers to add, remove, or modify various features to and from the application, giving high scalability to the application.
